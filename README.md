# PythonFuteristicQuiz
FuturisticQuiz is a sleek, Python-based quiz application that combines real-time AI-generated questions with a vibrant, sci-fi-inspired interface. Designed and built by a beginner developer, this project showcases how modern tools like OpenAI and Python's GUI libraries can come together to create a dynamic, interactive experience.

Key Features:

AI-Generated Questions – Every question is generated on the fly using OpenAI’s GPT model, ensuring a fresh, non-repetitive quiz every time.

Difficulty Selection – Players can choose from Easy, Medium, or Hard modes, each scaling up in complexity to match different skill levels.

Stylized Interface – A futuristic black-and-cyan theme with glowing buttons and smooth fonts gives the app a high-tech aesthetic.

Split-Line Question Display – Long questions are automatically split into two lines for optimal readability and design balance.

Dynamic Scoring System – The user’s score updates in real time, providing immediate feedback and motivation.

Background Music Integration – Lobby and quiz-specific background music plays via Pygame, enhancing immersion.

Built With:

Python

Tkinter + ttk (for the graphical interface)

OpenAI GPT API (for question generation)

Pygame (for sound and music)

Why It Stands Out:
FuturisticQuiz doesn’t just ask pre-written trivia. It dynamically creates new questions using AI and adapts to the user’s selected difficulty level—making every session unique. It’s more than a quiz app; it’s an engaging, visually distinct experience designed to both entertain and educate.

Note:
This project is intended for educational and personal use. It’s a great introduction to combining GUI development, API usage, and multimedia in Python.
